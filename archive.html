									<p> <blockquote>True praise and worship of God will not be limited to a church sanctuary (v 1-2, 6) Truly honoring God involves more than just singing songs or voicing praise during a worship service. Worship is a way of life that honors God and reflects his greatness in every aspect of life. We cannot help but praise God when we realize his greatness and goodness. His activity in creation, his plan of salvation for all people and his wonderful works in our personal lives...
									</blockquote></p>
										<span class="full-text" style="display: none;"> Praise becomes a powerful response of the heart expressing joy, gratitude and desire for a deeper relationship with our God. In addition to praising God with songs and instruments in the sanctuary, we can praise an bring honor to God by living out his love and joy to those around us (1 John 4:19)
											We show our faith in Christ (John 1:7) by gaining victory over the power of Satan (Eph 6:10-18) and by having a spiritual hunger for his purposes and his righteousness (Matt 6:33)
										   We honor God and give his praise through our deep devotion to his word (Ps 119:11) and by sharing the love for God that fills our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Rom 5:5)
										   Another way we can give glory to God is by spreading the message of forgiveness and new life through Christ (Rom 1:16) and by living with expectation of his soon return (Titus 2:13)
										   Praises are also used as a means of thanksgiving to God for his love, salvation, provision, protection etc. (Ps 103) This psalm expresses thanksgiving and praise to the Lord for the benefits and blessings he gives those who maintain a faithful relationship with him – we must never forget God’s goodness to us (Deut 8:12-14) or fail to thank him for the blessings he generally gives us through the Holy Spirit 
										   To show importance of praise Ps 150 starts with “Praise the Lord” and ends with “Praise the Lord”

									<p> <blockquote>Expressing gratitude for all that God has done for us should be one of the constant character traits of all Christians. This kind of gracious attitude will cause the believers to stand out no matter the circumstance he/she is in and be a good example for Christ.
										We are going to look at how Habakkuk and Paul responded to their circumstances...
										
									</blockquote></p>
										<span class="full-text" style="display: none;"> 1.	When God seems to be far away
											•	Unlike apostle Paul who never complained about his circumstances (prison and persecution) Habakkuk could not understand how gracious and Holy God could allow the Babylonians (ungodly people) to invade Israel.
											•	How long shall I call for help and you will not help or cry violence and you do not save? (1:2)
											•	To him God was unfair and unjust and should have used other means to discipline Israel but not through the Babylonians who were ruthless.
											•	He faced his challenges with a negative attitude (with complaints and murmuring)
											•	To him God was either not concerned or taking too long to answer but instead God told him, “Even if the vision tarries, it will be fulfilled at the appointed time” (God’s time) (Hab 2:3)
											
											
											2.	He remembered the doing of the Lord (Hab 3:1-2)
											•	“O Lord I have heard your report and your work, O Lord do I fear in the midst of the years revive it in the midst of years make it known and in wrath remember mercy”
											•	He remembered how God delivered his people from slavery in Egypt, how he led them through the desert to the promised land – and his miraculous works leading him to worship God in his circumstance.
											•	 Later, he declared, whether there was fruit on the vine or not, whether the fields would yield food or not or no cattle in the stalls he would rejoice in the Lord (3:17-19)
											•	God was the source of his strength – he put his hope in God again.
											•	No matter what we may go through we need to always remember what God has done to us through Christ and that he Is ever-present and concerned.
											•	Give thanks in every circumstance for it’s God’s will concerning us.
											•	A positive attitude towards God will keep us physically and spiritually healthy hence grant us favor before God.
											•	Habakkuk finished well- from complaining to praising God.
											
											Change your attitude towards God
