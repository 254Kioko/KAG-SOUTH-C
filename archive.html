									<p> <blockquote>1.	Ps 116:12-14
										•	The psalmist is praising God for all his benefits to him complementing what he is in Ps 103:2 – Not to forget all the benefits.
										•	The greatest of all the benefits from the Lord is spiritual salvation, which we should all be grateful...
									</blockquote></p>
										<span class="full-text" style="display: none;"> •	He chose to lift up the cup of salvation and also pay his vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.
											•	God loves a grateful heart.
											
											2.	Eph 3:20
											•	Apostle Paul praises God for being able to do exceedingly above all what we can pray for or think of. To him be the glory of the church and in Christ Jesus.
											•	Indeed, the Lord has done great things in our lives, family, church etc. even beyond what we expected for which we should give him thanks even as we trust him to visit us more.
											
											3.	Deut 8:12-20
											•	God warned the Israelites not to forget him after entering the promised land and they were blessed (He expected them to obey him as a form of thanksgiving to him)
											•	He told them not to be proud and think that it’s their power that had given them all their wealth for it’s He who gives power to get wealth in confirmation of his covenant (v 18) 
											•	Throughout the year God has given us business deals, favor, connection, opportunities etc. and we should always remember to praise him by serving him with our resources.
											
											4.	2 Chor 9:8-11
											•	Apostle Paul reminded the believers that as they faithfully and cheerfully served God then he would make his grace to abound so as to be enriched in all ways.
											•	God is able to supply and multiply our seed for sowing and equally increase the harvest.
											•	We give God all the glory that we have not lacked even as we continue to give towards the work of the ministry.
											•	We thank God for his provision even during this challenging time that we are in.
											
											5.	Job 1:10 
											•	God has blessed the work of our hands and our possessions have increased in the land.
